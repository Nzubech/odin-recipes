      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Egusi soup is native food in West-Africa (Nigeria). It is eaten with Garri, Fufu or Semovita, and its also nutritious to the body. Egusi is fortunately my best soup and it goes with goat meat to add more taste to the soup. This meaty, nutty, spicy soup is protein-packed and full of tasty greens. Try preparing it and enjoy the taste.</p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Boil the Meat</b>~ In a medium-sized saucepan, boil the beef seasoned with salt (garlic salt), smoked paprika, pepper, and onions until tender-make sure you add plenty of water, so you have about 3-4 cups of beef stock for the soup. Remove the beef and reserve the stock.</li>

          <li><b>Saute Onions, Meat and Crayfish</b>~ Heat the oil in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and saute until they are translucent, about 5 minutes. Then add the beef, smoked fish, and crayfish and continue cooking.</li>

          <li><b>Add the Tomatoes</b>~ Stir in the tomatoes with their juices, garlic and 1-2 cups of beef stock. Allow to boil and simmer for another 5 minutes.</li>

          <li><b>Now the Egusi</b>~ Add grounded egusi and simmer on medium heat for approximately 10 more minutes. Then add beef stock as needed to get the desired consistency.</li>

          <li><b>Add Spinach</b>~ Finally, throw in the spinach and let it simmer for 4-5 minutes. Adjust seasonings to taste.</li>

          <li><b>Serve</b> warm with rice, fufu, pounded yam or your favorite starchy side dish.</li>
